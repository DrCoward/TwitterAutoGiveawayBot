# Twitter Tree Bot

People say money doesn't grow on trees but with this project 
is basically does.

Twitter Tree Bot is a self-bot which automatically 
comments, likes, follows, and retweets giveaways to automically 
earn you cash or in game rewards.


## Features

- Auto Comment
- Auto Like
- Auto Retweet
- Auto Follow


## Installation

Install Python 3

Install required packages with Pip in the Terminal

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

To run the file you will need to change some variables.
Currently there are only 3 variables to change 
```
tweetCount = 100
searchTerm = "Soulstrife"
commentText = "Done @Bob @Joe"
```

TweetCount is the max # of tweets the bot will respond to.

SearchTerm combines "Soulstrife" and " Giveaway" so you don't need to include Giveaway in the search term. 

Comment is what the bot will comment on the post, currently their is no way to disable commenting.


---
You will also need to replace 2 more variables:
```
ct0 = "r39123i123jfaf"
auth = "41841y2fhahf4914fada"
```
You will need to open Dev Tools (Ctrl + Shift + I). Then copy your CT0 and Auth key as shown in the image.
